# About us
The PG BootCamp Initiative came into being out of a desire to empower PostgreSQL enthusiasts worldwide with the applicable knowledge and tools necessary for  PostgreSQL development and to encourage them to start contributing to the PostgreSQL project.
We strive to support the development of PostgreSQL as a powerful and reliable relational database management system, promote deepening the level of knowledge  among beginners and professionals, encourage the exchange of experience and interaction between PostgreSQL users, developers, and administrators all over the  world and become a global platform where everyone can find information, support, and inspiration for their development goals, ongoing tasks, and projects.
Our mission is to bring together PostgreSQL enthusiasts and experts in order to further contribute to the growth and development of this powerful database 
management system.
